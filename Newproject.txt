(app/models/project.rb)
ruby
Copy code
class Project < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :project_manager, class_name: 'User', foreign_key: 'project_manager_id'
  has_and_belongs_to_many :users # If users are assigned to multiple projects

  validates :name, presence: true
  validates :description, presence: true
end
2. User Model (app/models/user.rb)
Make sure you have a role column in the users table to manage roles like Admin, Project Manager, and User.

ruby
Copy code
class User < ApplicationRecord
  # Role definitions
  enum role: { admin: 0, project_manager: 1, user: 2 }

  has_many :managed_projects, class_name: 'Project', foreign_key: 'project_manager_id'
  has_and_belongs_to_many :projects # Users who are assigned to multiple projects

  # Validations
  validates :first_name, :last_name, :username, presence: true
end
3. ProjectsController (app/controllers/projects_controller.rb)
ruby
Copy code
class ProjectsController < ApplicationController
  before_action :authenticate_user!
  before_action :set_project, only: [:show, :edit, :update, :destroy]
  before_action :authorize_user!, only: [:edit, :update, :destroy]

  # List of projects based on user role
  def index
    if current_user.admin?
      @projects = Project.all
    elsif current_user.project_manager?
      @projects = current_user.managed_projects # Projects managed by the project manager
    else
      @projects = current_user.projects # Projects assigned to the current user
    end
  end

  # Show a specific project
  def show
  end

  # Form for creating a new project (for Project Manager or Admin)
  def new
    @project = Project.new
  end

  # Create a new project (only for Project Manager or Admin)
  def create
    @project = current_user.managed_projects.build(project_params) # Assign the current user as the project manager
    if @project.save
      redirect_to @project, notice: 'Project was successfully created.'
    else
      render :new
    end
  end

  # Form for editing a project (for Project Manager or Admin)
  def edit
  end

  # Update a project (for Project Manager or Admin)
  def update
    if @project.update(project_params)
      redirect_to @project, notice: 'Project was successfully updated.'
    else
      render :edit
    end
  end

  # Delete a project (only for Admin)
  def destroy
    if current_user.admin?
      @project.destroy
      redirect_to projects_path, notice: 'Project was successfully deleted.'
    else
      redirect_to projects_path, alert: 'Only Admin can delete a project.'
    end
  end

  private

  # Strong params for creating/updating a project
  def project_params
    params.require(:project).permit(:name, :description)
  end

  # Set project for show, edit, update, and delete actions
  def set_project
    @project = Project.find(params[:id])
  end

  # Authorization for project managers and admins
  def authorize_user!
    unless current_user.admin? || (current_user.project_manager? && @project.project_manager_id == current_user.id)
      redirect_to projects_path, alert: 'You are not authorized to perform this action.'
    end
  end
end
4. Routes (config/routes.rb)
Define the RESTful routes for projects.

ruby
Copy code
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  devise_for :users
  resources :projects
  root 'projects#index'
end
5. Views
Here are basic views for listing, showing, creating, and editing projects.

index.html.erb (List Projects)
erb
Copy code
<h1>Projects</h1>

<% if current_user.project_manager? || current_user.admin? %>
  <%= link_to 'New Project', new_project_path %>
<% end %>

<ul>
  <% @projects.each do |project| %>
    <li>
      <%= link_to project.name, project %>
      <% if current_user.admin? || (current_user.project_manager? && project.project_manager_id == current_user.id) %>
        <%= link_to 'Edit', edit_project_path(project) %> |
        <%= link_to 'Delete', project, method: :delete, data: { confirm: 'Are you sure?' } %>
      <% end %>
    </li>
  <% end %>
</ul>
show.html.erb (Show Project)
erb
Copy code
<h1><%= @project.name %></h1>
<p><%= @project.description %></p>

<%= link_to 'Back to Projects', projects_path %>
new.html.erb (New Project)
erb
Copy code
<h1>New Project</h1>

<%= form_with model: @project, local: true do |form| %>
  <div>
    <%= form.label :name %>
    <%= form.text_field :name %>
  </div>

  <div>
    <%= form.label :description %>
    <%= form.text_area :description %>
  </div>

  <%= form.submit 'Create Project' %>
<% end %>

<%= link_to 'Back to Projects', projects_path %>
edit.html.erb (Edit Project)
erb
Copy code
<h1>Edit Project</h1>

<%= form_with model: @project, local: true do |form| %>
  <div>
    <%= form.label :name %>
    <%= form.text_field :name %>
  </div>

  <div>
    <%= form.label :description %>
    <%= form.text_area :description %>
  </div>

  <%= form.submit 'Update Project' %>
<% end %>

<%= link_to 'Back to Projects', projects_path %>
6. Migrations
You will need the following migrations to create the projects table and the many-to-many relationship between users and projects.

Migration to Create Projects Table:
ruby
Copy code
class CreateProjects < ActiveRecord::Migration[6.1]
  def change
    create_table :projects do |t|
      t.string :name, null: false
      t.text :description, null: false
      t.references :project_manager, foreign_key: { to_table: :users }

      t.timestamps
    end
  end
end
Migration to Create Users-Projects Join Table (for assignments):
ruby
Copy code
class CreateUsersProjectsJoinTable < ActiveRecord::Migration[6.1]
  def change
    create_join_table :users, :projects do |t|
      t.index :user_id
      t.index :project_id
    end
  end
end
7. User Roles
Ensure that the users table has a role column for managing roles (Admin, Project Manager, User). You can add this by generating a migration:

bash
Copy code
rails generate migration AddRoleToUsers role:integer
Then update the migration file:

ruby
Copy code
class AddRoleToUsers < ActiveRecord::Migration[6.1]
  def change
    add_column :users, :role, :integer, default: 2 # Default to 'user'
  end
end
Conclusion
This complete code setup should handle:

Admin users who can manage all projects.
Project Managers who can create, manage, and assign projects.
Users who can view and be assigned to projects.
Make sure to run your migrations using rails db:migrate and check the functionality accordingly.

To allow Users to read (view) the projects assigned to them, you need to modify a few things in your controller, model, and views. Below are the steps to ensure that Users can view projects they are assigned to.

Update the ProjectsController
In the ProjectsController, ensure that Users can only access projects they are assigned to. We already have this functionality in the index action, but we also need to make sure it works in the show action.

Update the show action so that a regular user can only view the projects assigned to them:

ruby
Copy code
class ProjectsController < ApplicationController
  before_action :authenticate_user!
  before_action :set_project, only: [:show, :edit, :update, :destroy]
  before_action :authorize_user!, only: [:edit, :update, :destroy]

  # List of projects based on user role
  def index
    if current_user.admin?
      @projects = Project.all
    elsif current_user.project_manager?
      @projects = current_user.managed_projects
    else
      @projects = current_user.projects # Projects assigned to the current user
    end
  end

  # Show a specific project
  def show
    if current_user.admin? || current_user.project_manager? || @project.users.include?(current_user)
      # Allow access if the user is an admin, project manager, or assigned to the project
    else
      redirect_to projects_path, alert: 'You are not authorized to view this project.'
    end
  end

  # Other actions like new, create, edit, update, destroy remain unchanged

  private

  # Strong params
  def project_params
    params.require(:project).permit(:name, :description)
  end

  # Set the project for actions
  def set_project
    @project = Project.find(params[:id])
  end

  # Ensure only authorized users can edit, update, or destroy the project
  def authorize_user!
    unless current_user.admin? || (current_user.project_manager? && @project.project_manager_id == current_user.id)
      redirect_to projects_path, alert: 'You are not authorized to perform this action.'
    end
  end
end
Modify the show.html.erb View
In the show.html.erb view, make sure that the assigned users can see the project details.

Example of show.html.erb:

erb
Copy code
<h1><%= @project.name %></h1>
<p><%= @project.description %></p>

<% if current_user.admin? || current_user.project_manager? || @project.users.include?(current_user) %>
  <p>Assigned users:</p>
  <ul>
    <% @project.users.each do |user| %>
      <li><%= user.username %> (<%= user.role %>)</li>
    <% end %>
  </ul>

  <%= link_to 'Back to Projects', projects_path %>

  <% if current_user.admin? || (current_user.project_manager? && @project.project_manager_id == current_user.id) %>
    <%= link_to 'Edit', edit_project_path(@project) %> |
    <%= link_to 'Delete', @project, method: :delete, data: { confirm: 'Are you sure?' } %>
  <% end %>
<% else %>
  <p>You are not authorized to view this project.</p>
<% end %>
This ensures that Users assigned to the project can view the project details, while others are blocked from accessing it.

Update the User-Project Association in the Model
Ensure that your User and Project models have the necessary associations so that users can be assigned to projects.

User Model (app/models/user.rb):
ruby
Copy code
class User < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :managed_projects, class_name: 'Project', foreign_key: 'project_manager_id'
  has_and_belongs_to_many :projects # Users assigned to projects

  enum role: { admin: 0, project_manager: 1, user: 2 }

  validates :first_name, :last_name, :username, presence: true
end
Project Model (app/models/project.rb):
ruby
Copy code
class Project < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :project_manager, class_name: 'User', foreign_key: 'project_manager_id'
  has_and_belongs_to_many :users # Users assigned to this project

  validates :name, :description, presence: true
end
Migration for users_projects Join Table
Ensure that you have a join table between users and projects to manage the assignment of users to projects.

Here’s a migration to create the join table between users and projects:

ruby
Copy code
class CreateUsersProjectsJoinTable < ActiveRecord::Migration[6.1]
  def change
    create_join_table :users, :projects do |t|
      t.index :user_id
      t.index :project_id
    end
  end
end
This migration will create a join table users_projects that connects users to projects.

Conclusion
This full setup ensures that:

Admins can view and manage all projects.
Project Managers can create, edit, and manage their projects.
Users can only view the projects they are assigned to.
This gives you role-based control over who can view and manage each project.
