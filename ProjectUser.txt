To implement a system where a manager can create projects and assign them to users, and users can only see the projects assigned to them, you would typically set up your project with models, controllers, and views in a way that enforces these rules. Here's an outline of how you can do it in a Rails application:

Models
User: Represents the user (managers and normal users).
Project: Represents the project created by the manager.
Assignment: A join model that ties users to projects (many-to-many relationship).
Migration files:
User Model (users table): Add role to distinguish between managers and users.
ruby
Copy code
rails generate migration AddRoleToUsers role:string
Project Model (projects table): Add basic information about projects.
ruby
Copy code
rails generate model Project name:string description:text manager_id:integer
Assignment Model (assignments table): Create a join table to assign projects to users.
ruby
Copy code
rails generate model Assignment user_id:integer project_id:integer
Run the migrations after creating them:

bash
Copy code
rails db:migrate
Models Setup
User Model (user.rb)
ruby
Copy code
class User < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :assignments
  has_many :projects, through: :assignments

  # Distinguishing between manager and normal users
  def manager?
    role == 'manager'
  end
end
Project Model (project.rb)
ruby
Copy code
class Project < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :manager, class_name: 'User', foreign_key: 'manager_id'
  has_many :assignments
  has_many :users, through: :assignments
end
Assignment Model (assignment.rb)
ruby
Copy code
class Assignment < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :user
  belongs_to :project
end
Controllers
Projects Controller
Manager's Controller: projects_controller.rb - for managers to create and assign projects.
ruby
Copy code
class ProjectsController < ApplicationController
  before_action :authenticate_user!

  # Managers create projects and assign to users
  def new
    @project = Project.new
    @users = User.where(role: 'user')
  end

  def create
    @project = current_user.projects.build(project_params)
    
    if @project.save
      # Assign users to the project based on the selection
      @project.user_ids = params[:project][:user_ids]
      redirect_to @project, notice: 'Project created and assigned successfully.'
    else
      render :new
    end
  end

  private

  def project_params
    params.require(:project).permit(:name, :description, user_ids: [])
  end
end
Users' View Controller: assigned_projects_controller.rb - for users to view only their assigned projects.
ruby
Copy code
class AssignedProjectsController < ApplicationController
  before_action :authenticate_user!

  def index
    # User can only see their assigned projects
    @projects = current_user.projects
  end
end
Views
New Project Form (For Managers)
Create a form that allows the manager to create a new project and assign it to users:

erb
Copy code
<!-- app/views/projects/new.html.erb -->
<h1>Create New Project</h1>

<%= form_with(model: @project, local: true) do |form| %>
  <%= form.label :name %>
  <%= form.text_field :name %>

  <%= form.label :description %>
  <%= form.text_area :description %>

  <%= form.label :users %><br>
  <%= form.collection_check_boxes :user_ids, @users, :id, :email %>

  <%= form.submit 'Create Project' %>
<% end %>
Assigned Projects (For Users)
Create a view that allows users to see only the projects that are assigned to them:

erb
Copy code
<!-- app/views/assigned_projects/index.html.erb -->
<h1>Your Assigned Projects</h1>

<% if @projects.any? %>
  <ul>
    <% @projects.each do |project| %>
      <li><%= project.name %> - <%= project.description %></li>
    <% end %>
  </ul>
<% else %>
  <p>No projects assigned to you yet.</p>
<% end %>
Routes
In config/routes.rb, define the routes for managing projects and viewing assigned projects:

ruby
Copy code
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  devise_for :users
  
  # Manager routes
  resources :projects, only: [:new, :create, :show]
  
  # User routes
  resources :assigned_projects, only: [:index]
  
  root to: 'assigned_projects#index'  # Users are redirected to their assigned projects by default
end
Authentication & Authorization
Ensure you use a tool like Devise for user authentication. You can check the current_user and its role to enforce role-based access control.

Manager: Only a manager should be able to create projects.
User: Users should only see projects that they are assigned to.
Conclusion
With this structure, managers will be able to create and assign projects, and users will only see the projects they are assigned to.
